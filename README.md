# A Dhammapada Site Generated from JSON

This repository will generate a [static website having the Dhammapada as content](https://dhammapada.michaelnordmeyer.com/).

It generates from `dhammapada.json` the HTM, a sitemap.xml, and a robots.txt. It needs `quickjs` for that, a tiny JavaScript interpreter, which can be installed on macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install quickjs`

The `Makefile` has everything to make and deploy the site. Its configuration is located at the beginning.

For successful generation of the favicon with `generate-icon.sh`, a font with the used Unicode character of the wheel of dharma has to exist at the location declared in the script. Depending on the font, the centering of the character has to be adjusted. It works out-of-the-box on macOS, if `imagemagick` was installed with `brew install imagemagick`.
